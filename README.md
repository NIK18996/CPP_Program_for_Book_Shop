## What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.

## Why C++?
* C++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.
* Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.
* C++ is also used to do low level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver etc. It also supports the feature of high level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.
* C++ is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.
* C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.
* It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.
* The compilation and execution time of C++ language is fast.
* C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array etc.
* In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.
* C++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features
* C++ is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.
* C++ is a compiler based programming language, it means without compilation no C++ program can be executed. First we need to compile our program using compiler and then we can execute our program.

## Problem Statement
A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message “Required copies not in stock” is displayed. Design a system using a class called books with suitable member functions and Constructors. Use new operator in constructors to allocate memory space required. Implement C++ program for the system.
